Designed for minimal friction and maximum interactivity.

Main Canvas
• Infinite 2D space for all drawing/writing actions
o Dynamically expands as users draw/move beyond current boundaries
o No hard pixel limit (expands as needed)
o Smooth panning: Click and drag to move around canvas
o Grid background (optional toggle on/off)
o White default background
New Page Button
• Creates a brand-new blank canvas
• Each canvas gets a unique identifier
• All canvases are saved and accessible via Canvas Menu
2. Real-Time Collaboration
Multi-User Editing
• Simultaneous users: Support 2-10 users editing the same canvas in real-time
• Real-time sync: All drawing, text, shape, and image actions sync instantly across all connected users
• User presence indicators:
o Show colored cursor labels for each user (e.g., "User 1", "User 2")
o Display what tool each user is currently using
o Show user count in toolbar
• Conflict resolution:
o Last action wins for overlapping edits
o Each action has timestamp to determine order
• Connection status:
o Visual indicator showing connection status (connected/disconnected)
o Auto-reconnect on connection loss
o Queue actions during disconnection and sync when reconnected
Code-Based Sharing
• Each canvas generates a unique 6-8 character alphanumeric code
• Users can share this code to invite others
• Code entry interface: Simple input field on homepage
• Valid code = instant access to shared canvas
• Codes are persistent (don't expire)
3. Canvas & Performance Specifications
Canvas Details
• Size: Truly infinite — dynamically expands as users work
• Performance target: Smooth performance with up to 1,000 objects on canvas
• Rendering: Only render visible viewport + small buffer area
• Optimization:
o Lazy loading for images
o Object culling (don't render off-screen elements)
o Debounced sync for drawing actions (batch updates every 50-100ms)
Image Handling
• Maximum file size: 10MB per image
• Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, SVG
• Image manipulation:
o Resize by dragging corners
o Maintain aspect ratio (with Shift key override)
o Rotate in 90° increments
o Delete option
o Layer ordering (bring to front/send to back)
4. Save/Export Functionality
Auto-Save
• All changes automatically saved to local database
• Save frequency: Every 5 seconds or after significant action
• No manual "Save" button needed
• Session recovery if browser/app crashes
Export Options
• PNG Export:
o Full canvas export
o Visible area only export
o Custom resolution options (1x, 2x, 4x for high-res)
o Transparent or white background
• PDF Export:
o Auto-fit content to page
o Multiple pages if canvas is very large
o Maintain aspect ratios and quality
Canvas Management
• All canvases persist in database
• Access via Canvas Menu dropdown
• Each canvas shows:
o Thumbnail preview
o Creation date
o Last modified date
o Canvas name (editable)
