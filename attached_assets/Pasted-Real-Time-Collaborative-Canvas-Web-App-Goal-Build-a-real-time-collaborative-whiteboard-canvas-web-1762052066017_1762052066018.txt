Real-Time Collaborative Canvas Web App
Goal:
Build a real-time collaborative whiteboard/canvas web app that allows 2–10 users to draw, write, or edit on the same canvas simultaneously with full live synchronization and user tracking.

🔐 User Identity & Device Recognition
•	When a user first visits the app:
o	Prompt them to enter a name (e.g., via modal input field).
o	Automatically generate a unique user code based on device fingerprint (using libraries like FingerprintJS or custom hash).
o	Store {name, code, fingerprint} locally (in localStorage or IndexedDB).
•	On subsequent visits:
o	The app recognizes the user by fingerprint → automatically restores their name and code.
o	No need to ask again.

🖥️ Canvas & Collaboration
•	Users can create a new canvas or join an existing one (via code or shared link).
•	Each canvas supports up to 10 users editing in real time.
Features:
•	Real-time sync of:
o	Drawing (freehand)
o	Text
o	Shapes
o	Images
•	All actions instantly replicate across all connected users.
Implementation Options:
•	Use WebSockets (e.g., Socket.io, Supabase Realtime, or Firebase Realtime Database) for syncing.
•	Canvas rendering via HTML5 Canvas or Fabric.js for object manipulation.

👥 User Presence Indicators
•	Each connected user is assigned:
o	A unique color
o	Their name + code (shown in UI)
•	Show live cursors for each user:
o	Display colored cursor with their name above it (e.g., "Sarah – Pen").
o	Update in real time as they move.
________________________________________
🧰 Toolbar Features
•	Toolbar contains:
o	Tool options (pen, text, shape, image, eraser, select, etc.)
o	Current user’s name and color
o	"Active Users" button → when clicked:
	Displays list of all connected users:
	Name
	Code
	Currently selected tool
	Color indicator
•	Show total user count in toolbar (e.g., “👥 5 users online”).
________________________________________
🖊️ Attribution & Cursor Labels
•	Every drawing, text, or edit on the canvas:
o	Is tagged with the user who performed it.
o	When hovering over an object or area, show a tooltip:
	“Edited by Sarah”
	“Written by Alex”
•	Optionally store object metadata like:
•	{
•	  "objectId": "shape_123",
•	  "userName": "Sarah",
•	  "userCode": "A94F2",
•	  "timestamp": 1730498412000
}
Conflict resolution: o Last action wins for overlapping edits o Each action has timestamp to determine order • Connection status: o Visual indicator showing connection status (connected/disconnected) o Auto-reconnect on connection loss o Queue actions during disconnection and sync when reconnected Code-Based Sharing • Each canvas generates a unique 6-8 character alphanumeric code • Users can share this code to invite others • Code entry interface: Simple input field on homepage • Valid code = instant access to shared canvas • Codes are persistent (don't expire) 3.
