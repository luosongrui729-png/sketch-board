Real-Time Collaborative Canvas Web App

Goal:
Build a real-time collaborative whiteboard/canvas web app that allows 2–10 users to draw, write, or edit on the same canvas simultaneously with full live synchronization and user tracking.

🔐 User Identity & Device Recognition

When a user first visits the app:

Prompt them to enter a name (e.g., via modal input field).

Automatically generate a unique user code based on device fingerprint (using libraries like FingerprintJS or custom hash).

Store {name, code, fingerprint} locally (in localStorage or IndexedDB).

On subsequent visits:

The app recognizes the user by fingerprint → automatically restores their name and code.

No need to ask again.

🖥️ Canvas & Collaboration

Users can create a new canvas or join an existing one (via code or shared link).

Each canvas supports up to 10 users editing in real time.

Features:

Real-time sync of:

Drawing (freehand)

Text

Shapes

Images

All actions instantly replicate across all connected users.

Implementation Options:

Use WebSockets (e.g., Socket.io, Supabase Realtime, or Firebase Realtime Database) for syncing.

Canvas rendering via HTML5 Canvas or Fabric.js for object manipulation.

👥 User Presence Indicators

Each connected user is assigned:

A unique color

Their name + code (shown in UI)

Show live cursors for each user:

Display colored cursor with their name above it (e.g., "Sarah – Pen").

Update in real time as they move.

🧰 Toolbar Features

Toolbar contains:

Tool options (pen, text, shape, image, eraser, select, etc.)

Current user’s name and color

"Active Users" button → when clicked:

Displays list of all connected users:

Name

Code

Currently selected tool

Color indicator

Show total user count in toolbar (e.g., “👥 5 users online”).

🖊️ Attribution & Cursor Labels

Every drawing, text, or edit on the canvas:

Is tagged with the user who performed it.

When hovering over an object or area, show a tooltip:

“Edited by Sarah”

“Written by Alex”

Optionally store object metadata like:

{
  "objectId": "shape_123",
  "userName": "Sarah",
  "userCode": "A94F2",
  "timestamp": 1730498412000
}
